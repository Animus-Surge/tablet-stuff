# tablet-stuff

Project for Surge's custom tablet project.

## About

This is a project that I (Surge) am using to do more research on the workings for a raspberry pi zero 2 w. The goal is to create a functional cosplay prop and usable device that I can then upgrade and modify as time goes on to suit the needs of what I am currently working on. Hopefully, in the future, there will be stuff like expansion modules, as well as better hardware to allow for extra functionality.

The first part of this is coming up with a sci-fi styled user interface to act as a cosplay prop that I can take to conventions. Functionality will include networking, file management, as well as just looking cool in general. Hardware for this version of the project is a raspberry pi zero 2 w, a custom I/O board containing slots and pins for UART expansion modules as well as a dual 18650 cell battery managment system and power level monitor, and an off-the-shelf screen module acquired from The Pi Hut.
